## Why This Project Exists

Many non-technical people use ChatGPT and Claude like a search engine: ask a question, get
an answer. But these tools can do much more - they can make your computer do things, not
just answer questions.

This project exists to help people bridge that gap. It came from noticing that the jump
from "chat with AI in a browser" to "AI helps me build and automate things on my computer"
is confusing without guidance.

The goal is minimum viable understanding - enough to get started and learn by doing, not
enough to become a software engineer.

## Contributing

- **Suggest improvements:** Open an issue with your idea

This guide tries to stay simple and practical. When contributing, keep in mind:
- The audience is non-technical people who are new to all of this
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract explanations
- Do not assume knowledge of programming concepts
- Keep it short - people can always learn more later
