# scripts/

This folder is for standalone utilities - single-file scripts that do one thing.

For example:

- `rename_files.py` - Renames files in a folder to a consistent format
- `backup_to_drive.sh` - Copies important files to Google Drive
- `check_prices.py` - Checks a website and emails you if a price drops

These are the "buttons" from the guide - small tools you build once and reuse.

If a script grows into something larger with multiple files, move it to `projects/`.

You can delete this file once you start using the folder.
