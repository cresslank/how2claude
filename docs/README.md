# docs/

This folder is for documentation and notes. It is yours - organize it however makes sense.

Some things people put here:

- A folder of research papers or articles on a topic
- Daily notes or a work journal
- Reference materials you want the AI to be able to read
- Design docs or specifications for things you are building

You can delete this file once you start using the folder.
