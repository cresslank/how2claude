# About This Project

This is **how2claude**, a tutorial and template repository for non-programmers learning to use
AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Droid, etc.).

The guide content lives in `guide_docs/`. When you fork this repo for your own project, edit
this file to describe what you are building and how you want the AI to behave.

## About Me

<!-- Edit this section to describe yourself and your context -->

I am not a professional programmer. I am learning to use AI coding tools to build things.

## What I Want Claude to Do

<!-- Add things here as you discover what works well for you -->

- Explain what you are doing and why, especially for non-obvious steps
- Keep things simple - favor clarity over cleverness
- When I ask for something, tell me if it is more complex than it sounds. I may not realize
  a "simple" request actually involves many steps or tricky edge cases.
- Ask clarifying questions before starting large tasks

## What I Don't Want Claude to Do

<!-- Add things here when Claude does something annoying -->

- Don't comment out code. If something should be removed, delete it.
- Don't create extra markdown files, READMEs, or documentation unless I ask.
- Don't over-engineer. No unnecessary abstractions, config files, or patterns that add
  complexity without clear benefit.
- Don't add features I didn't ask for.

<!-- Example: "The API rate limits to 100 requests per minute" -->
