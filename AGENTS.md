# Project Instructions for AI Coding Tools

<!--
This file is for AI coding tools other than Claude Code (which uses CLAUDE.md).
Tools that read this file include: Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, and others.

The content mirrors CLAUDE.md — customize both files for your project,
or keep them in sync by editing one and copying to the other.

## About This Project

<!-- Describe what you're building in 1-2 sentences -->
This is a new project. Update this section with what you're building.

## About Me

I'm not a professional programmer. Please:
- Explain what you're doing and why
- Keep things simple when possible
- Ask clarifying questions before making big changes
- Warn me if something might break existing functionality

## Project Structure

<!-- Update this as your project grows -->
```
.
├── CLAUDE.md       # Instructions for Claude Code
├── AGENTS.md       # This file (instructions for other AI tools)

```

## Commands

<!-- Add commands you use frequently -->
```bash
# Example commands - replace with your own
python main.py              # Run the main script
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
npm start                   # Start a Node.js project
```

## Preferences

<!-- Customize these to match how you like to work -->
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Write comments explaining non-obvious code
- Use Python 3.11+ (or specify your preferred language)
- Create small, focused commits

## Things to Remember

<!-- Add project-specific notes here as you learn them -->
- (Add notes as you work, e.g., "The API rate limits to 100 requests/minute")
- (e.g., "User data is in the `data/` folder, don't commit it")

## Don't

<!-- Things you want Claude to avoid -->
- Don't make changes without explaining them first
- Don't delete code without asking (comment it out instead)
- Don't add unnecessary dependencies
