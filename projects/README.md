# projects/

This folder is for project code. Each project gets its own subfolder.

For example:

```
projects/
├── inflation-chart/     # The FRED data project from the tutorial
├── expense-tracker/     # A small app you built
└── file-organizer/      # A utility that cleans up your downloads
```

Each subfolder can have its own structure - whatever makes sense for that project.

You can delete this file once you start using the folder.
