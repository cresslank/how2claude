# Why This Setup

## Why bother with all this?

If you are not technical, you might be wondering:
"Can't I just use ChatGPT in my browser? Why do I need terminals and Git and all this stuff?"

You can absolutely start with just the browser. But here is why this setup pays off:

The browser hits a wall. Chat interfaces are great for questions and small scripts, but they
cannot see your files, run your code, or remember your project structure. You end up
copy-pasting constantly, explaining context over and over, and manually applying every change.

These tools work with your files. Claude Code, Codex, and Droid can read your entire project,
make changes across multiple files, run commands, and iterate based on errors - all without you
playing middleman.

Git is your undo button. When you are experimenting with AI that can modify your code, you need
a safety net. Git lets you checkpoint your work and roll back when things go sideways. This is
non-negotiable.

The setup is a one-time cost. Yes, there is friction upfront. But once you have done it once,
starting new projects takes minutes.

If you are still skeptical, try building one small thing with this setup.

## The philosophy

These tools let you describe what you want in plain English and have AI write the code. The key
insight: you are not learning to code - you are learning to collaborate with something that
codes.

This guide avoids "always do XYZ" prescriptions. Instead, it teaches the mental models and
vocabulary to figure things out as you go.

## The mindset

You are not trying to become a programmer. You are learning to collaborate with a very fast,
very literal assistant that happens to write code.

The AI is like an eager junior employee: technically capable, but needs clear direction. Your
job is to:

1. Know what you want (roughly)
2. Communicate it clearly
3. Review the work
4. Course-correct as needed

Start small. Build something trivial. Break it. Fix it. The confidence comes from doing, not
from reading guides like this one.
