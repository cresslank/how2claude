# Create Your Project

This is a template repository. Instead of cloning it directly, create your own copy.

**Prerequisite:** You need Git installed. If you haven't done that yet, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md#choose-your-os-path).

## Use this template

1. Click the green "Use this template" button at the top of this page.
2. Select "Create a new repository".
3. Name your repo (for example, `scratch` for a playground).
4. Click "Create repository".

## Clone it to your computer

"Cloning" downloads the repo to your machine so you can work on it locally.

```bash
# macOS/Linux
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scratch.git
cd scratch

# Windows (PowerShell)
cd ~\Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scratch.git
cd scratch
```

Now you have a folder on your computer that is connected to GitHub.

Next steps:
- Update your instructions file: [Project Structure and Instructions](project-structure.md)
- Start your first session: [Your First AI Coding Session](first-session.md)
