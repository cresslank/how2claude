# Create Your Project

This is a template repository. Instead of cloning it directly, create your own copy.

**Prerequisites:**
- A GitHub account. If you do not have one, create one at [github.com](https://github.com/) - it is free.
- Git installed on your computer. If you have not done that yet, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md#choose-your-operating-system).

## Use this template

1. Click the green "Use this template" button at the top of this page.
2. Select "Create a new repository".
3. Name your repo (for example, `scratch` for a playground).
4. Click "Create repository".

## Clone it to your computer

"Cloning" downloads the repo to your machine so you can work on it locally.

```bash
# macOS/Linux
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scratch.git
cd scratch

# Windows (PowerShell)
cd ~\Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scratch.git
cd scratch
```

Now you have a folder on your computer that is connected to GitHub.

Next steps:
- Update your instructions file: [Project Structure and Instructions](project-structure.md)
- Start your first session: [Your First AI Coding Session](first-session.md)
